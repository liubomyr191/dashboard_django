Must haves
===============================================
Core and contrib
-----------------------------------------------
+ Layouts:
    + Android layout.
    + Windows 8 layout.
    + Twitter bootstrap 2.
    - Twitter bootstrap 3.
    - Foundation 5.
+ Documentation.
+ Group widgets.
+ Plugins:
    + Memo plugin.
    + URL plugin.
    + RSS feed plugin.
    + Weather plugin.
    + Simple news plugin.
    + Video plugin.
+ Unify the CSS usage, so that colours for font-awesome icons do get the same colour from layout.
+ Apply CSS unifications to News plugin.
+ Public dashboard (visible to everyone).
+ CRUD operations for models ``DashboardSettings``, ``DashboardWorkspace``, ``DashboardEntry`` based
  on Django permissions.
+ Template tags for permissions (edit dashboard, add workspace, etc) and templates properly adjusted.
+ Add extensive logging.
+ Make sure no strange things happen logged in with no administartive privelleges.
+ Fix Internet Explorer bug (layout not centered).
+ When running on Python 3, b'string' like values appear in the front end. Get rid of that!
+ Add authentication templates to the example application.
+ Stand alone templates top menu on click style fix.
+ Basic Django tests.
+ Demo app (installer), which would create records.
+ Log out link.
+ List all (or most important) overridable settings.
+ Add news app to the demo app installer. Create a new workspace on which news app would be shown. Use
  Delusional Insanity images as image factory. Take those images from a bitbucket repository.
+ Add licenses.
+ In the example app, make use of bulk-save.
+ When user is not logged in and log out link is chosen to be shown, show the log in link.
+ Update documentation on what's related to Windows 8 layout placeholders.
+ At the moment, plugin widget UIDs are invalid in terms of HTML (should start with a letter). Fix this.
+ In documentation, link to specific plugin directory on github or code in documentation.
+ Update documentatio in what's related the plugin access rights management.
+ Find out why huge news and rss feed plugin JavaScripts appear on pages where they are not used. Somehow,
  on the first page load, all plugins are loaded correctly, but when user goes to some other page where
  other plugins are used and then goes back to the previous page, the plugin scripts from the initial page
  are still loaded.
+ Make it possible to obtain the layout object by name in the template, in case if user needs some strange
  HTML setup.
+ Get rid of the lines in the layout. Replace them with dots, like on Android or Ubuntu.
+ At the moment, removing of a workspace does trigger removal of its' all dashboard entries, however, it
  doesn't clean-up the plugin data (files or database records), while it should!
+ Ensure, that all files saved have unique filenames!
+ Placeholder cell margins.
+ Add public dashboard hoocks.
+ Make the rest of the menus and dialogues to be shown in the same style as Bootstrap 2 layout (when
  Bootstrap 2 layout is loaded).
+ Limit the number of icons for URL plugin when in Bootstrap layout.
+ Make sure all selenium tests still work after HTML changes.
+ Fix issue with "edit" icon not shown on the widge in edit mode (only "delete" is shown).
+ Fixed issue when the left gray menu (workspaces) is empty in cases when only default workspace is
  available.
+ Fix image plugin bug with "Fit width" and "Fit height" resize methods.
+ For each plugin, create base widgets. Further, move all layout specific widgets to the layout modules.
+ Widgets dialogue in bootstrap style for Bootstrap layout (find a proper theme!).
+ Fix bug with public dashboard app not showing entries for `example` layouts. This is actually caused by
  probably not well tested placeholder usage by name in templates.
+ Allow users to make their workspaces clonable. Then, some other user could clone someone elses
  workspace to his own.
+ Make plugins cloneable.
+ Refactor plugin widgets. The very base one (size related) should be in plugin specific directory.
  All layout related things shall be in layout itself. Make sure to move layout specific media
  files (JS/CSS) into layout static directory.
+ Add bulk update to Django's admin interface of dash.models.DashboardPlugin, in order to be able to
  assign rights to certain plugins for users and groups at once.
+ Plugin and widget factory, for creating plugins and widgets easier (since it's mostly just extending
  some plugin or widget, just changing the name and rows/cols).
+ Bookmark plugin.
+ Simplify the plugin data update mechanism (when plugin data for certain ``DashboardEntry`` objects
  shall be updated using ``dash.utils.update_plugin_data``).
+ Fix the issue with missing top background image in Django admin.
- Leave the bundled plugins but also release each of them separately (bitbucket,
  github, PyPI) in order to simplify improvements and make it easier to
  modify them as needed.
+ Django 1.7 support.
+ When using unicode characters found in workspace slug, ``django-slug`` raises an exception.
- Fix Google Chrome bug, when dash widget controls (edit/delete) being hidden under Youtube video.
- Strange problems with hover in IE (all versions).
- Add workspace create/delete/edit tests.
- Use factory in example layout.
- Check docs and apply factory.
- In Russian not all the text fits nicely into the overlays. For "Bootstrap2" layout, all overlays
  are scrollable and too much text is not a problem. For "Android", "Windows8" and "Example" layouts
  it's an issue. Optimise the CSS in such a way, that the overlays are scrollable and heading
  backgrounds grow with text.
- Check all translation messages, as some of them are not properly shown in Russian locale.
- Check if it's possible to add plugins without config (without form).
- Rewrite the Javascript and core templates with bootstrap3 in mind. Support old themes as well.
- Add information (especially license information) of the third-party apps used in the project.
- Test dash with plugin which doesn't have a form. If problems occur, use the
  the yet unreleased ``django-fobi`` approach.
- Add "rem" (and other CSS units) to the list of available cell units.

-----------------------------------------------
+ Image plugin (with options to: crop, fit width or fit height).
+ Think of a convention on naming the plugins and widgets.
+ Make installation instructions for all plugins, especially advanced ones (that require to be added
  to ``urls`` module).
+ Now that delusionalinsanity.images is available and downloadable on github, make changes to
  the images grabbing script in such a way, that it no longer requires mercurial or is system
  dependant (just downloads the zip and unpacks it using python built-in shutils).
+ Add `get_width` and `get_height` shortcut methods to the base plugin widget.
+ Add translations for Dutch.
+ Add translations for Russian.
- Make it possible to use something else than Django's ORM (django-mongoengine,
  SQLAlchemy).
